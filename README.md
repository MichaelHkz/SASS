Abstract: This paper explores peripheral modernity in the island of Jamaica. Jamaica’s
self-perception of being an island, as evidenced in texts and imagery, is not one that is
peripheral, bounded, limited, small, or isolated. The trope of islandness, of interest to
travellers and tourists, has been expressed both visually and textually, but it centers on being
a tropical location as opposed to islandness per se. Although there has been a practical,
literary and visual connection with the sea, the sea has not been portrayed as a separator but
rather as a conduit and connector, no different from a continental coast. The process of
modernization of Kingston, the island’s capital and main port city, strongly reflects this
‘un-islanded’ or ‘continental’ self-perception, challenging the notion of peripheral modernity.
Kingston was not imagined as a periphery at all by those who embraced and implemented
the modernization project. This was so even while Kingston’s hinterland, during the period
under study (1960-1980), was largely rural, under-developed and poor. Kingston’s
geographical position, as a mainland port on a relatively large island, by Caribbean standards,
facilitated the imagining and implementing of modernity following continental models. These
arguments are built on an examination of the separate but interconnected ideas and practices
of architect Wilson Chong, and the architectural firm Shankland Cox, using technical reports
and periodical articles as primary sources.

1. Modernity: Beyond lines of latitude
The disciplines of Island Studies and Urban Island Studies seek to uncover the “material [...]
non-material [...] and epistemological” realities of island existence (Swaminathan, 2014).
Historically, islands are occupied, represented, imagined and managed in ways that are
unique to the particular geographic and cultural contexts of territories that are surrounded
by water. Islands may be potentially isolated, may be a part of archipelagos, are at varying
distances from continental land masses, exhibit varying levels of urbanization and may,
through land reclamation activities become joined to other islands or mainlands. The
habitation of islands involves the materiality of construction, engineering and reshaping of
landscapes, as well as distinctive imaginaries, or poetics of ‘islandness’ (Grydehøj, 2014;
Pigou-Dennis & Grydehøj, 2014; Kinder, 2015).
An intriguing aspect of the scholarship on architecture and cities in the Caribbean islands is
that there is virtually no engagement with themes of ‘islandness’. The tropical location of the
islands, as well as their former and in some cases still current status as colonies of maritime
Western European empires provide the most pervasive frames of reference for analytic
purposes (Stagno, 2001; Caselas, 2009; Lauber, 2007; Segre, 2001). This has been the case
across a range of related disciplines, including architectural history and theory, literature,
and art history until very recently, when the concept of Small Island States and issues of
sustainability and climate change have come to the fore (UTech, Jamaica International
Conference, 2005). Recent analyses of the emergence of modern architecture in Caribbean
islands have offered no context of ‘islandness’ (Rodriquez & Mores, 2005). This reality is
overtly noted by only one scholarly work, in the field of Jamaican historical geography
(Higman & Hudson, 2009, p. 245):
Modern Jamaicans rarely refer to themselves as islanders. The fact of living ‘on’ an
island, let alone a small island, is rarely vocalized or problematized. The sea is not
regularly in sight, and there are only rare opportunities for intervisibility with other
islands, notably glimpses of Cuba from the Blue Mountain Peak. Psychologically,
Jamaica is continental. A peripatetic person may be referred to as temporarily ‘on the
island’ or ‘off the island’, but for most Jamaica is simply home, homeland, yard, the
Rock, JA or Jamdown.
Indeed, Higman and Hudson’s commentary quoted above is the only direct reference to
Jamaican ‘islandness’ as opposed to simply being an island, that has been discovered in
academic literature in the fields of the humanities and human geography. This is highly
relevant to the ensuing discussion about Kingston and modernity in this paper. In short, it
will be argued that the relative lack of a public concept of islandness, especially as a peripheral,
isolated, romanticized location, helped to pave the way for the pragmatic modernizing project
for Kingston, especially the Kingston Waterfront. Ironically, the waterfront project may be
seen as a part of a process of un-islanding, which was in keeping with the Jamaican psyche.
Put another way, Jamaica’s self-concept as an island was outward-looking, pragmatic, and
not at all peripheral.
Higman has also discussed the Caribbean islands in terms which allow for an interpretation
of the reasons for this peculiar quality of islandness. Referring to the Caribbean Sea, he
asserted, “Without the islands there would be no sea.” As an archipelago, “the islands of the
Caribbean surround and demarcate the sea rather than sitting in it” (Higman, 2011, p. 1).
The islands are wholly separate from mainlands, and, particularly in the Greater Antilles
chain, of which Jamaica is a part, are hardly visible to each other. Tracing an arc that separates
the Atlantic Ocean from the Caribbean Sea, the islands became a main seam in the blending
Urban Island Studies

of the trans-Oceanic worlds, through the maritime, imperial projects of Western European
nations between the fifteenth and twentieth centuries. This process made the islands “prime
sites in the fateful modern colonization that brought Europeans and Africans across the
Atlantic to the Americas” (Higman, 2011, p. 3).
This interpretation of the Caribbean islands launches them from a mere insular and
peripheral setting to the centre stage of a process that was part of a broad sweep of
modernization in its own right. The implication is that notwithstanding the decline of the
agro-industrial plantation complex by the nineteenth century, the Caribbean Islands, and
specifically Jamaica, had already become a part of globalizing and modernizing processes,
which intensified in the decolonization period of the twentieth century.
Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that there are paradoxes and complex layers in the
projections of Jamaica’s sense of islandness, and not all of these can be addressed within the
scope of this paper. One major paradox was that since the eighteenth century, Jamaica has
been projected as the cultural imaginary of an exotic paradise for travellers and tourists,
through landscape paintings, travelogues and descriptive writing. These tropes were
particularly concerned with the nature of tropical landscapes, both tamed and untamed, and
the cultural landscapes of exotic African and Asian populations (Thompson, 2006). It is
important to bear in mind that this tourist landscape and seascape was vital to Jamaica’s
twentieth century economy, and yet this did not preclude modernist interventions in the form
of hotels in Ocho Rios and Montego Bay, in the same time frame as the Kingston waterfront.
The complex configurations of global islandness have been discussed at length elsewhere. (Parry,
1993; Sivasundaram, 2013; Baldacchino, 2008; Grydehøj, 2014). The specific examples that
will be discussed here are selected works of the Jamaican-Chinese architect, the late Wilson
Chong, and the Kingston Waterfront Redevelopment Project, whose lead architect was the
United Kingdom (U.K.) firm, Shankland, Cox and Associates. They are separate but related
strands of the process of envisioning and implementing a modernist vision for the city.
2. Kingston’s background: An accidental city
Jamaica’s southeast coast has a harbour that is protected by the Palisadoes spit – a peninsula
whose western end is home to Port Royal, the famous pirate town of the seventeenth century,
which lost much of its fabric in the earthquake of 1692. In the aftermath of this disaster, the
town of Kingston was founded across the harbour from the sunken city. From this accident,
emerged a planned urban space, consisting of a tight grid. The new town was conceptualized
by John Goffe, as a compact grid, which was drawn by Christian Lilly (see Figures 1 & 2).
The town was bounded on the south by Harbour Street, and by East, West and North Streets,
encompassing 240 acres, three quarters of a mile north to south, and half a mile east to west.
Over the next two and a half centuries, the city expanded in all directions – adding reclaimed
land to the south, and spreading further west, east and north, eventually subsuming the
southern portion of the bordering parish of St. Andrew, in 1923 (see Figure 4). This urban
site inherited three significant features: the harbour, which is the seventh largest in the world;
the site of the Liguanea flood plain, an extensive flat landscape which merges in to the foothills
of the third feature – the Blue Mountains. The harbour made Kingston the centre of trade
and commerce for the island, eventually wresting the role of administrative capital from
landlocked Spanish Town.

Urban Island Studies, 3, forthcoming.
The Liguanea Plain provided the means for the city to expand beyond the original grid, as
townships, suburbs and commercial hubs spread east and especially north, urbanizing
livestock pens and villages and reaching by the 1960s, into the foothills of the Blue Mountains.
Finally, the city is almost entirely surrounded by hills and mountains, except for the
waterfront to the south. The capacity to expand, and the drift of the city away from the coastal
zone, towards the mountains engaged the city with land features rather more than seascapes.
This contributed to the ‘continental’ psyche noted by Higman and Hudson.

Kingston was not an urban island. It was not a part of an archipelago, and with much of its
built fabric developed away from the sea edge, the city did not develop an islanded sensibility.
The prolific Jamaican author H.G. DeLisser, for instance, writing in the early twentieth
century, compared Kingston to continental cities: “This handsome island has not a handsome
city,” he declared, almost apologetically contrasting the low-rise city to Chicago, Detroit and
Manhattan. He considered Kingston to be a more slow paced town “as compared with the
movement in the cities of England or the United States,” due to the discomfort of the heat
and humidity, yet, he also acknowledged its scenographic qualities. He classified the main
commercial artery, King Street as “Jamaica’s Broadway, Oxford Street, Boulevard des Italiens,
too, if you like” (DeLisser, 1913: 76). Its harbour was “among the largest and finest in the
world,” and was a “magnificent sheet of water fringed with mangrove plant and cocoa-nut
palm,” and the mountainous background was a “mighty wall, green-clothed and cloud-capp’d”
(DeLisser, 1913: 78, 79). Implicit in his description is the recognition of the island and tropical
geography of Jamaica, yet explicit in his description is the transposing of the island city from
its tropical, island context to comparative images of a more cosmopolitan, or continental
setting. This mental navigation, from island to continent, was a prologue, so to speak, to the
processes of modernization that would emerge later in the century.

3 Modern architecture in Jamaica: context
Discourses and practice related to processes of modernization in Jamaica were almost entirely
confined to the capital city of Kingston, and its earliest phase can be traced most especially
to the period of rebuilding and adjustment after a severe earthquake in 1907 (Pigou-Dennis,
2009). Much of the core or downtown of the city crumbled under the force of that quake,
forcing the rebuilding of the city according to a new building code. The 1908 code stipulated
ferro concrete construction, later modified to steel reinforced concrete, and limited building
height to two stories. Notwithstanding the advancements in terms of materials, the new buildings,
which were both commercial and civic in function, tended to retain historicist architectural
typologies. The commercial buildings along the main east-west artery, Harbour Street, and
King Street, the main north-south axis were configured with faux Beaux Arts facades. The
new public buildings, also built along King Street, embraced an abstracted version of
colonnades and galleries that interpreted tropical, colonial typologies derived from Palladianism.
It was not until the 1950s that a modernism of taller buildings devoid of historic referents
emerged in Kingston. This was due to two main factors. One was the emergence of a first
generation of Jamaican architects, who had been educated overseas. The other was a
conscious ethic of modernization and redevelopment that was pursued by the British and
Jamaican governments, within a context of decolonization and newly minted independence.
As Jamaica’s dominant port, Kingston facilitated the import-export agendas of the British
colonial government, and the city became a hub for commerce, banking and other services.
The city supported several waves of suburban expansion, with each successive movement
northwards and eastwards, leaving fabric that was taken over by poor rural migrants who
became the poorest urban dwellers.

This population was largely unemployed or employed in the lowest paying jobs, such as wharf
laborers for males and domestic service for women. The informal, tenement yard settlements of
the urban poor spread throughout western Kingston, a zone which was also characterized by the
city’s garbage dump and public cemetery. By the 1950s, the buildings that had been reconstructed
after 1907 were showing signs of wear and tear, and the port facilities were increasingly unsuitable
for larger ships (Clarke, 2006). Interestingly, Figure 4 below shows a statue of Queen Victoria,
gracing the pier and market also bearing her name. These emblems of the British empire,
located at the waterfront made a clear symbolic, outwardly oriented link towards the global
imperial system. These emblems would be erased in the project of modernization.

 The discussion below will highlight two related aspects of the visualizations and interventions
which would generate modern architectural insertions in Kingston, and the re-imagination
of the waterfront.
4. Architect Wilson Chong: Modernity beyond borders
Wilson Chong was a Jamaican in a truly globalized context. Born to a Jamaican-Chinese family
in Santiago Cuba, his architectural education was achieved in the United States, at the University
of Notre Dame and the University of Illinois, from which he graduated in 1952 with a degree in
Architecture. He was one of the first Jamaicans to become a licensed Architect, and to engage in
private practice on the island. It has been said that he faced difficulties in establishing his practice,
given that both private and public sectors were accustomed to architects from overseas. Chong
was versatile as a maker, inventor, designer and organizer of the architectural profession in Jamaica
and received a number of awards. Chong’s design of concrete shell structures was quite innovative
and produced visually striking results in his gas stations, a medical centre, a church, and other
structures (Robinson, 1985). For at least some of these structures he worked in collaboration with
the engineer Fred Benghiat of the firm Firth, Cleveland Reinforcement, a British company.
Benghiat had attended the World Conference on Shell Structures in San Francisco in 1962
(‘Trade and Commerce’, 1962). Thin shells were a modern structural system. Although derived
from ancient vaulting techniques, the new material of reinforced concrete enabled a lighter
more efficient means of distributing roofing loads. Illustrations in the Architectural Forum
in the 1960s demonstrate that the thin shell system was an innovative structural development
with pleasing aesthetic impact (‘Concrete Shell Roof’, 1963; ‘Thin-Shell Roof’, 1963).
Chong was an avid admirer of Le Corbusier, and he embraced specific elements of his architectonic
principles – notably the brise soleil, which were shading devices or screens to modulate light, and
pilotis, which were pillars that raised a building one floor off the ground, thus maximizing service
spaces and green space. He employed the brise soleil to good effect on the Henriques Building,
as it was known at that time, creating a facade that utilized an asymmetric, gridded pattern
of concrete, that was unique within its context. The pilotis were integrated with the design
of the Ministry of Education Building along the Race Course, which would become known as
the National Heroes Circle. This was the first usage of this structural system in Jamaica.

However, his most notable project was the design of the island’s National Stadium. The
stadium was constructed in 1961, as part of public building projects that would prepare the
island for independence in 1962. It was clearly understood in its role as a political and
nationalist statement of identity for the island.
There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the public generally are keen that Jamaica
should have our own National Stadium. The necessity for this is seen as ever greater
and more urgent as we prepare to embark on the era of Nationhood (Ramsay, 1961).
The Stadium was, from its inception, an icon embedded in the social history of the island, through
the significance of spectator sports, and it was a structure that showcased the country globally,
via international games, such as the Commonwealth Games in 1966. This social significance
would not have been possible without the innovative structural system that Chong had contrived.
The basic design unit of the grandstand of the Stadium is a tripod in reinforced concrete,
from which a curved cantilevered beam springs, and the roof is a four inch thick concrete
shell spanning between the beams in a circular cylindrical shape (Robinson, 1985).

This building was one of a number of global stadiums that were featured in the Architectural
Forum’s special feature of 1963. The featured examples, from countries such as the U.S., the
Netherlands, Malaysia, Japan, as well as Jamaica all grappled with the structural issues
involved in seating thousands of persons on several levels, providing roof coverage for at least
part of the structure, and of course, providing the facilities for sporting and other mass public
events. Chong’s design seated 6000 in the grandstand, and 24,000 in bleachers.
The structure of the grandstand consists of 22 arched concrete frames, each connected
to its neighbors in combined footings and grade beams. The frames are joined in a tripod
support visible in the back of the stadium. This tripod support […] braces the structure
against wind and earthquake. Each of the frames extends into a 68-ft cantilever, and
the shallow concrete vaults shade nearly half the seats (‘Stadiums’ 1963).

Chong succeeded in pushing the limits of concrete and steel to meet the needs of the stadium
brief. The completed execution merited mention not only in the prestigious Architectural
Forum, but his work was featured in fifteen overseas publications, including the Architectural
Record. He also won the inaugural cycle of Jamaica’s most prestigious architectural prize,
the Governor General’s Award for Architecture, in 1964, and the Mexican architectural prize,
the Aztec Pin of the Mexican College of Architects (Robinson, 1985).
There were a number of pioneering modernist Jamaican architects in Chong’s generation,
including Vayden McMorris, Jeremy Sibley, Bert Robinson and Harold Morrison. Chong
stands out for the diversity of structural experiments he attempted, for his multifaceted
contribution to his profession. He remained a leading exponent of modernism in Jamaican
architecture, up until his untimely death in 1984. His trajectory as a designer exemplifies the
cross-currents and paradoxes of the status of island colonies turned independent island
nations. The key personnel in terms of engineering and architecture were almost always from
the U.K. Since the earlier decades of the twentieth century, Jamaicans who desired to practice
in these fields had to travel overseas for tertiary education. Wilson Chong fell into this latter
category, receiving his architectural education in the U.S. as mentioned above. His generation
of professionals was sandwiched between the era of solely expatriate professionals, and the
island’s capacity to provide tertiary education locally in the second half of the century.
Architectural education was not initiated in Jamaica until 1988, with the founding of the
Caribbean School of Architecture at the then College of Arts, Science and Technology.
The reality of receiving architectural training abroad was of utmost significance in the context
of architecture. Architectural design education in the U.S. was overwhelmingly geared to the
conditions of temperate climate, and the cultural milieu was entirely different. This was one
potentially problematic issue – how to adapt modern architecture that was suited for the
fast-paced urban living in temperate climates, to the tropical conditions of a much less
developed island city. Jamaica was not by any means the only postcolonial nation to grapple
with these issues. Countries in Africa, South America and Asia likewise had to deal with
complex social, political issues as well as climatic adaptation in hot, humid or arid conditions
(Beng, 2001; Rodriquez, 2005; Jackson, 2013; Bay & Ong, 2006). To be sure, the climatic
issues of the tropics and sub-tropics were not new, given that the British, and other European
colonizers, had long extended their imperial claims and practices in the torrid zones (Jackson
& Holland, 2014; Danby, 1963). Indeed, in the case of the British, there was a long history of
formal architectural education and policy making to facilitate climate-friendly adaptations
of British architectural works in the colonies (le Roux, 2003).
The most comprehensive project that facilitated an engagement of modernism with the
Jamaican context involved the discourses and execution of re-development of the capital city
Kingston, most especially its waterfront zone, after 1966. Modernism intersected with a
number of variables – foremost were climatic and tectonic conditions of earthquake risk. But
there was also the adventure of creating a national identity, a makeover of the urban skyline
and shoreline, and engaging directly with issues of underdevelopment and mass poverty. In
all of these, Wilson Chong also played a significant role, as the City Architect.
The 1960s were heady days for Jamaica, as the island engaged on a path of economic
diversification and industrialization, seeking to overcome the disadvantages of being a small,
underdeveloped, former island colony. Indeed, the economic growth rate of Jamaica during
the 1960s has remained unsurpassed. There is little evidence of serious antipathy in 1960s
Urban Island Studies

Urban Island Studies, 3, forthcoming.
Jamaica, towards the ideal of modernization, and the key symbols of this process – taller,
modern buildings. Concrete was a natural choice of building material as the island was able
to manufacture it locally. Chong quickly established himself as an advocate for and leader of,
the modernization process. In his practice he demonstrated key aspects of the capacity to
think beyond the periphery of a small island identity. Chong’s thinking and the execution of
his architectural interventions in the city, mark an intensification of a long-standing capacity
on the part of key actors in Jamaican society, to un-island themselves, and in so doing, to
perpetuate the tendency to think and act in ‘continental’ terms. While Kingston’s modernist
buildings have been surveyed by Lawton (2005) and Taylor (2010), these have emphasized
the responses to tropical climate, materiality and technological innovation, but have not
explicitly addressed a context of “islandness”.
In the Ministry of Education Building, the National Stadium, the Henriques Building, Texaco
Service Station and Oxford Medical Centre, he demonstrated his verve and grasp of the the
technical and aesthetic potentials of concrete. (Robinson, 1985) His forms fit their functions,
each one a unique iteration. He was an innovator in technical and design modes and he
showed sensitivity to climate in the Henriques brise soleil, and Stadium cantilevers. He
responded to earthquake risk in the Stadium tripod structure. He made modernism work in
Jamaica. Making use of externally generated technological and aesthetic paradigms, which
he was exposed to in his studies overseas, he demonstrated critical design thinking, and
aligned his own professional goals with the nation building project of the island.
While Chong’s thinking may be discerned from the actualization of the above-mentioned
architectural projects, it is the public record of his involvement with the waterfront
regeneration that his thinking as an architect is made clear. The revisualization of the
waterfront engaged multiple actors – Chong, as City Architect, the leading political figures,
investors, the media, the newly formed Urban Development Corporation (UDC), and the
British firm of Shankland, Cox, and Associates.
5. Modernist urban regeneration: Stating the problem
The map in Figure 2 above shows the city grid, with the old finger piers. The city was
bifurcated by the central axis of King Street, the main commercial centre, which was centered
on a public open space, which was first a military parade ground, and then a park. The
southern frontage to the sea was first occupied by Harbour Street, and then, on reclaimed
land, by Port Royal Street. The northern and eastern boundaries of the expanded Kingston
were framed by the Blue and John Crow Mountains and Long Mountain.
From its inception, Kingston responded to the pragmatic island context of Jamaica, and its
trans-Atlantic relationships of trade, including the slave trade. Kingston remained the largest
British West Indian port and city, and its activities were dominated by mercantile commerce
and shipping. Plantation slavery had a profound effect on Kingston, among other things,
creating an enclave of urban slaves in the western section of the city. When slavery ended in
1838, a steady and increasing stream of migrant rural peasants found their way into western
Kingston, enlarging the slums and informal settlements of that part of the city. This legacy
continued down to the independence period and beyond. Like many cities globally, Kingston
embraced the process of suburbanization, with increasing sprawl towards the foothills of the
surrounding mountains. The drift north was accompanied by the decay of entire neighborhoods
Urban Island Studies

Urban Island Studies, 3, forthcoming.
in the lower sections of the city, and the expansion of slum conditions. Yet the connection to
the sea, through the port, remained a vital aspect of the economy of the city, and the entire
island hinterland. It is against the problem of urban decay and neglect, and the extreme
poverty of most of the lower city’s residents, that urban regeneration was conceived, as a
means to “slow the deterioration of Kingston into one vast slum” (Simmonds, 1966).
Chong played an integral role in the framing of the problems facing Kingston, pursuing his
advocacy through the Jamaican Architectural Society, the Chamber of Commerce, by hosting
public seminars and through the medium of interviews with the leading newspaper, the
Jamaica Daily Gleaner. He submitted comprehensive proposals for reconfiguring of King
Street (the central north-south axis) and the Parade, the public space which was bisected by
King Street. His discourse was peppered with references to global precedents, both successes
and failures, in cities such as Chicago and Detroit in North America. In fact he freely admitted
that his architectural education in the United States had influenced his thinking about
architecture and cities (Simmonds, 1966a; 1966b). He also contrasted Kingston’s decay with
initiatives to create new cities in Brazil, India, Belize and the United Kingdom.
This underscored the fluidity with which ideas and practices flowed between the island city
and more developed ‘centers’ of knowledge and practice. Chong interpreted the problems of
Kingston as part of an islandwide context, and advocated rural redevelopment and nucleation,
so as to ease the population pressure on West Kingston. Yet at the same time, he advocated
the application of continental solutions. He argued that the capital would remain an area of
density, and advocated mass housing in high rise apartment buildings, the rationalization of
mass transit, and the development of pedestrianized shopping areas and green spaces with
public art to provide relaxation and respite. He visualized arch flyovers in the city centre, the
curtailment of urban sprawl and lamented the waste of land that suburban dwelling entailed
– citing Los Angeles as an example of poor urban design. He preferred ‘progress’ to ‘nostalgia’,
and the journalist Ulric D. Simmonds lauded Chong for his “architectural imagination”
(Simmonds, 1966a). Chong’s thinking revealed a multi-layered vision of the city as an island
place with continental aspirations.
Chong was not the only actor on the stage of re-visualizing Kingston as a modernized city,
however, and ultimately, the modernization project devolved to other protagonists. Edward
Seaga, then the Minister of Development and Welfare in the fledgling independent
government led by Hugh Shearer, had also led initiatives that married private investment
with government authority and had begun the redevelopment of the waterfront by relocating
the harbour piers westward, to the expanded and upgraded facilities of Newport West, with
plans for a Newport East. The modernized port facilities were also a part of a comprehensive
development plan that created an industrial zone in the vicinity of Newport West, and cleared
the most pernicious slum area in West Kingston, replacing this with the medium rise
apartment blocks and community facilities of Tivoli Gardens.
Seaga’s initiatives included the regeneration and complete reconfiguration of the old port
frontage, through a project that entailed private sector investment, investment by the newly
post-imperial British government, and the hiring of the British architectural firm of
Shankland, Cox, and Associates to carry out the master plan, as consultants to the Town
Planning Department. This move by the two governments underlines the complexities of
centre and periphery formulations. On the one hand, it might seem to have been a regressive
move - reasserting the primacy of British funding and technical expertise, and a foreign vision
Urban Island Studies

of how the waterfront should look and function. On the other hand, it is clear that initiative
came from the national government, which was itself genuinely framing a definition and
intervention of ‘modernity’ for the tropical, island port.
There was a robust and genuine public input – though this was skewed in favour of the middle
and upper classes. This took the form of discourse in public meetings and the print medium,
as well as materially, in the form of the land swaps between private owners and government
that facilitated the development.
6. “The most modern complex in the Caribbean”
The reconstruction of the Kingston waterfront was launched with high hopes, an infusion of
capital and expertise, spearheaded by clear and direct governmental policy which bore the
imprimatur of the enthusiastic and competent Seaga. Submissions to the Cabinet, under his
signature set the stage for the collaboration between the Jamaican and British governments
- creating a flow of technical assistance in spite of the formality of loosening the ties of
imperial governance (Central Government, 1968). He reported that the British Ministry of
Overseas Development had, in effect sponsored the consultancy of the firm Shankland, Cox
and Associates, thus facilitating the visit of Graeme Shankland to Jamaica for nearly a month,
in December 1965 and January 1966 (Central Government, 1966). Shankland’s visit was
followed by a final technical report in early 1968.
The flux of local and foreign ideas was well encapsulated in the words of Seaga at the outset
of the project: “We hope that downtown Kingston will have a bright lights centre that all big
cities have as a focal point of attraction. […] A Piccadilly Circus of Kingston” or a “sort of
Times Square.” He envisaged a public square, surrounded by entertainment establishments,
providing lively activities during the night as well as the day (‘City Waterfront
Redevelopment’, 1967). Not unlike H.G. DeLisser, who was writing just over half a century
earlier, Seaga’s mental navigation encompassed the island city, yet instantly transposed
continental or cosmopolitan cityscapes to the local context.
The final reports from Shankland, Cox provided attractive sketches of the proposed
waterfront, and set out the technical drawings and details attendant on the project. A model
was also presented to the government. In short, the project provided for the development of
150 acres which would be advanced in three phases. The old finger piers at the foot of King
Street would be removed and replaced with a new cruise ship terminal. A new east-west
thoroughfare, Ocean Boulevard, would be constructed, fronting the harbour, and lined to the
north by a series of high rise building blocks housing a hotel, an apartment complex with
shopping mall, and an office complex. There would be a square, pedestrian walkways, and a
parking garage in close proximity. The later phases of the development would see additional
mixed use projects comprising commercial buildings and apartment complexes to the east.
Further, there was to be an entertainment complex to the west and another hotel with more
housing in the adjoining parish of St. Catherine (Shankland, Cox, and Associates,1968).
A dramatic new skyline will soon rise from the central waterfront section of Kingston.
Hotels, shopping centers and entertainment facilities interconnected by promenades
and walkways will create Jamaica’s first metropolitan resort area, introduce ‘downtown
living’ and restore night life to the city centre. All will have easy access to the tree shaded
waterfront where only cruise ships will berth (Jamaica Information Service, 1968).

The vision did become reality to a significant degree. By 1977, the Ocean Boulevard was
completed, with its cohort of modern multi storied blocks of Ocean Towers Apartments, the
Kingston Mall, the UDC office complex and the Oceana Hotel and parking garage.
The Bank of Jamaica was completed at the westernmost part of the waterfront site, and the
Forum Hotel to the west were also completed. This alteration of the city’s skyline and profile
invited critical academic comment. Writing in 1977, Bruce Young addressed issues that are
central to the dissemination of modernism from centre to periphery.
That much of the new built environment is generally indistinguishable from that t o
be found in higher latitudes may be regrettable, but it is as inevitable perhaps, as the
fact that Third World Cities, redesigned increasingly by persons trained in the First
World, should utilize technologies and concepts associated with Western societies
(Young, 1977: 77).
Young expressed the central dilemma of the center-periphery opposition which had been
fostered by the imperial configuration of metropolitan centers with advanced economies
derived in large measure from the exploitation of the raw materials of ‘peripheral’ islands
and continents. While raising a question about the cultural and geographic provenance of
Modern architecture, his analysis of the project contained some elements of resolution of
this dilemma. He acknowledged that the developmental needs of the Kingston waterfront
might have much in common with similar projects in North America and Europe, adding
that the outcome was the result of a “mix of functions and the design features that the experts
considered appropriate and modern” (Young, 1977: 77). He emphasized that the UDC was
“wholly owned” by the Government of Jamaica, and that this entity had acquired the acreage
for the development, and emphasized the initiative taken by the government. Although Young
did not explicitly shape his argument around a theory of islandness, nevertheless, he had
identified conflicts between local and foreign architectural typologies and contexts, especially
Urban Island Studies

Urban Island Studies, 3, forthcoming.
as these related to culture and climate. His commentary is valuable, in that it demonstrates that
there despite the strong impetus towards modernization, there was scope for dissenting opinions.
Is there evidence that the Shankland, Cox, and Associates intervention gave consideration
to the paradox of integrating a tropical, island environment with the worldview of a British
architectural firm committed to Modernism? The firm’s ethos was clearly stated in its
Technical Report - “Today, styles and materials are international” (Shankland, Cox, and
Associates, 1968: 39). The ultimate aim was for “unity and coherence” in a visual and
functional whole, as opposed to an ad hoc assemblage of individual structures. This was
considered to be the most appropriate response to Kingston’s reality of “visual chaos” and
“disorder” in which “a picture is presented which is depressing and uncared for; it is not the
picture that is usually associated with the downtown of a capital city.” The regeneration
project was not intended as a one-off intervention, but as “the first stage in the gradual
renewal of downtown Kingston” (Shankland, Cox, and Associates, 1967).
The Institute of Landscape Architects (ILA) in the UK reported favorably on the Kingston
project, highlighting those aspects of the Technical Report which dealt with environmental
and landscape issues. The reprint of text from that Report was juxtaposed against the nearly
half page photograph of the model of the proposed development. Indeed, the model showed
a waterfront sheared of its ragged finger piers, crumbling warehouses and assorted buildings
with corrugated roofs. Instead, the proposed light hued edifices had strong orthogonal lines,
mainly horizontal, but with some strong vertical notes. The coastal edge was a sharp linear
strip which included a cruise ship terminal. There was an engaging rhythm of varying building
heights, varied depths of setbacks, with long and short facades alternated as they fronted the
main thoroughfare, and a pattern of courtyards between buildings.
The ILA emphasized what it may be argued was the most location-sensitive aspect of the
entire urban design – the attention to tropical climatic context. The Jamaican microclimate
along the waterfront was taken into account – the two main needs were to provide shade and
to avoid blocking breezes from the sea. The alternation of the wet and dry seasons were taken
into account, as the planting of new vegetation would require steady watering. This was
designed so as to be supplied by new wells, as the groundwater was easily accessible. The
model shows a tree lined main boulevard, along with other plantings. Indeed, the Technical
Report devoted attention to “Urban Form and Landscape Principles”, to social and economic
context, the patterns of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, to existing land use and not least, to
earthquake risk. There was another significant concession to local context in the vibrant and
colorful mural on the lobby of the Kingston Mall, by Jamaican artist, Jerry Craig. This mural was
supposed to represent Jamaica’s symbolic “womb” giving birth to a new nation. (Lane, 1975).
7. In retrospect: Paradox of island urban modernity
“Jamaica would never have developed at all without Kingston’s waterfront” (‘The Task of Creating
a New Kingston’, 1966). The waterfront project straddled two main paradoxes – the relationship
of the city to its hinterland, and the relationship of the island nation to the international
context. It is argued here that there was a pragmatic recognition of the value of the waterfront
for the economy of the island as a whole, which the port and industrial developments sought
to address. Yet the aesthetic and architectural visualization of the waterfront, whether viewed
from the sea, air or from the land, firmly anchored Kingston in the era of continental,
International Style modernism, notwithstanding gestures towards climatic adaptation.

Urban Island Studies, 3, forthcoming.
However, the Kingston Redevelopment Project was never manifested in its entirety. The
mid-1970s change of the ruling political party shifted leadership to Michael Manley, whose
democratic socialist vision for Jamaica entailed a massive social engineering intended to
leverage the poor. These intentions alienated many in the middle and upper classes, and both
foreign and local investments dried up. Intense rivalry between the political parties
consolidated control of voting constituencies in downtown Kingston’s residential
communities, known as ‘garrisons’. Garrisons became affiliated with organized crime, with
gun violence, and fiercely defended boundaries.
The urban and architectural developments of the 1960s to the mid-1970s were the most active
since the rebuilding after the 1907 earthquake. This phase occupies the heart of the paradox
of centers and peripheries, and the destinies of small, tropical, island nations and their cities.
There was a cultural awakening amongst Jamaica’s architects who had returned from overseas
study, of whom, Wilson Chong was one of the most influential. His works certainly responded
to a range of issues, tackling climate, concrete technology, mass housing and containing massive
crowds of spectators. He theorized the urban space in terms of the modernity that he had observed
abroad, and the ethos he had studied. So, dense high rise concrete buildings containing
dwellings and commercial offices, mixed use, public parks, mass transit and fly overs were
all a part of his vision. He saw decay, slums and the chaotic movement of vehicular traffic as
the biggest blights on the city. His career, the interviews he gave and his public interactions
constituted a microcosm of the flow between center and periphery, and the absorption of
characteristics of the center by the periphery, so as to blur boundaries, to some extent.
While there were elements in common between his vision and that of other leading
proponents of urban regeneration, it was not to him that the ultimate project devolved.
The Seaga-driven redevelopment of the port facilities and the urban waterfront re-engaged
with the empire in a new guise. Thus funding and expertise flowed north south, as the
Technical Report shows. As the discussion above shows, Shankland, Cox, and Associates gave
due consideration to social and to climatic conditions. They imported current global (as
defined by the West) standards of urban design. There was international recognition and
publication of the work of both Chong and Shankland, Cox, and Associates evincing the extent
to which they had drawn modernism in Jamaica into the global mainstream. In general, it
does not appear that the commercial and intellectual classes in Jamaica objected to the overall
thrust of regeneration, and to the creation of a modernist skyline along the Kingston
waterfront. There was a flurry of compliments in the press: “Kingston has become a modern
metropolis, towering buildings now distinguish the skyline, modern architectural structures
of concrete, glass and steel have proliferated” (‘Supplement 100 Years of Kingston as Capital
City’, 1972). The intervention was presented for public media consumption as a tableaux fit
for a modernist utopia in a tropical setting. Thus, “ornamental trees, pools and fountains,
the sparking ocean in the background”, combined “cool ocean breezes” with “magnificent
modern stores” and paths “closed to motor traffic” (Lane, 1975). Nevertheless, the new tall
buildings required air conditioning.
The 1960s and much of the 1970s were an era of dynamism in the construction industry in
Kingston. Concrete, which was manufactured in the island, became the material of first choice.
Kingston, and by implication Jamaica, participated in an international phenomenon that in
some ways blurred the distinction of place, thus enacting a process of ‘un-islanding’ by
Urban Island Studies

implementing continental, modernist architectural solutions, notwithstanding a subtle
re-islanding through according some consideration of the scenic and climatic context. This
process highlights the central argument of this paper – that Jamaica was historically and
geographically positioned to simultaneously articulate an awareness of island geography,
even while the main thrust of the island’s cultural imaginary, and that of the city of Kingston,
was, paradoxically, continental. Thus, the ideas and works of Wilson Chong in Kingston, and
the Shankland, Cox, and Associates Kingston Waterfront Redevelopment project were
exemplary of the capacity of the island to think in continental terms. This paper has amplified
the theme of Jamaica’s continental consciousness that was raised by Higman and Hudson,
and as such, is the first publication to explicitly address the theme of ‘islandness’ with respect
to the modern architecture and urban design of Kingston.

Community-Driven Approach and
Housing Provision in Jamaica
CAROL ARCHER
University of Technology, Jamaica
Abstract
In many developing countries, one aspect of the government’s poverty reduction strategy is the provision of low-income housing units. Scholars and
donor agencies have now agreed that poverty is multi-dimensional, and
people living in poverty need a wide range of solutions targeting the individual, the community and the state. Since the 1990s, research on poverty
alleviation has shown greater emphasis on community-driven development and strengthening the capacity of community-based organisations
as an effective means of alleviating poverty. The paper examines whether
the provision of low-income housing units serves as a more effective tool for
poverty reduction when compared with a community-driven development
approach. The community-driven approach is discussed from the perspective
of the assets of the individual and the communities and how these assets can
be improved for the sustainable growth and development of the individual
and the wider community. Also, the community development approach to
poverty alleviation assumes that residents of communities, who are the target
population for poverty alleviation, should be active and equal partners in
deciding on the distribution of resources to the community. On the other
hand, the provision of low income/low-cost housing units typically focuses
on the role of the market in the design, construction and overall delivery of
the units to the targeted recipients.

Introduction
It is important for any poverty reduction strategy to focus on the needs of the wider
community to address poverty at the level of the individual. Scholars and donor
agencies have now agreed that poverty is multi-dimensional, and people living in
poverty need a wide range of solutions targeting the individual, the community
and the state. Since the 1990s, research on poverty alleviation has shown greater
emphasis on community-driven development and strengthening the capacity
of community-based organisations as an effective means of alleviating poverty.
The community-driven development approach begins by focusing on the assets
of the individual and the communities and how these assets can be improved
for the sustainable growth and development of the individual and the wider
community. This is a welcome departure from the approach to poverty alleviation employed in the 1970s and 1980s. Back then poverty alleviation approach
focused on “blame the victim.” Oscar Lewis, the American scholar, made this
victim approach to poverty popular based on his extensive research of Mexican
immigrant families in the United States.
The fundamental underpinning of the community-driven development process
is empowerment. This includes the empowerment of the individual and the wider
community. Empowerment in the broadest context refers to access to information
that allows for expanding choices. More concretely, it expands choices and the
freedom to act on those choices (World Bank, May 2002, p. v). Furthermore, the
community development approach to poverty alleviation allows the residents of
communities, who are the target population for poverty alleviation, to be active
and equal partners in deciding on the distribution of resources to the community. The community-driven development approach also recognises the role of
the state (elected officials) as an integral partner. Similarly, non-governmental
organisations, the private sector, and donor agencies (internal & external) are
recognised as important partners in the community-driven development process.
More aptly stated, the community-driven development process allows for
forging functional links between residents, community-based organisations,
and formal institutional reform (Dongier et al., 2003, p. 4). Taylor and Donoghue (2016) defined community-driven development as a way to strengthen civil
society by prioritising the actions of communities and their perspectives in the
development of social, economic and environmental policy. Most importantly,
community development seeks to empower local communities and strengthen
the capacity of people to be active citizens through their community groups.

Vol. 14, No. 1, March 2022 45
It is important to note that the community-driven development is not an
activity or set activities but a process in which community building and sense
of place allowed for top-down and bottom-up approaches. In some instances, it
has been concerned with the delivery of services to a particular community and
maintaining standards. In other cases, it has been about transferring control of
services, such as social housing or disability care, to the local community and
developing services to meet local needs (Taylor & Donoghue, 2016).
The community-driven development approach is a direct response to the failure of the market-driven economy in providing a safety net through which all
can access basic goods and services. This approach is also a direct response to
the failure or limitation of state-operated mechanisms for the provision of basic
goods and services to the most vulnerable members of society.
By nature, the community-driven development process is inclusive and participatory. In the early 1990s, there was an awakening call from donor agencies
for greater participation of citizens at the community level to address empowerment and poverty alleviation issues. This call for participation came against the
backdrop that when the poor participate in the decision-making process, it is
likely that limited public resources will be distributed to capture local knowledge
and consider local priorities.
Critical Concerns of the Community-Driven Development
For any community-driven development initiative to be successful in alleviating
poverty certain critical questions must be considered.
1. What is the spatial concentration of poverty? From an urban planning perspective, location and concentration are important variables to determine
the type of intervention. This is because community development initiatives
for an urban area will differ significantly from that of a rural or suburban
area.
2. What are the subgroups of persons living at or below the poverty line? This
allows the population to be categorised by gender, age, and other socio-demographic characteristics.
3. Are the subgroups accessing poverty alleviation services? Categorisation
helps determine whether specific programmes are reaching the targeted
population or the most underserved group (Barker & Schuyler, 2004).

Application of Community-Driven Development
I agree with Drnevich (1995) that the application of community-driven development must follow some fundamental principles that must be adhered to for the
success of the proposed development. Below is the list as outlined by Drnevich:
1. Involvement. Involve the people being affected. The basis of the partnership
is the people affected by the problem. They must be part of the solution. These
affected partners may vary with different community problems-housing
rehabilitation vs commercial revitalisation vs crime.
2. Understanding. Common understanding and common goals for the common
good. The goals of the partnership, its purpose and the solutions it is trying
to achieve should be firmly established. The results and the benefits to the
general community should be clearly understood.
3. Honesty. Understanding the cause of the problem, the ramifications and
costs of the alternative solutions, political realities, and the time and effort
required for implementation are paramount for success. The partnership can
be eroded by its members not being “upfront” with “the way things really
are” or by their not delineating “the changes that must occur to proceed.”
The trust that develops in a partnership is based upon this honesty. A reputation of trustworthiness enhances the credibility of the partner and, thus,
the ability to implement part of the solution.
4. No hidden agendas. Disruption, mistrust and reduction of credibility are
the results of the hidden agendas of one or more partners. Ground rules must
be set so that political and personal gain at the expense of the common good
will not be tolerated.
5. Define Roles. Define the role of each partner that utilises his or her expertise.
This ground rule realises that respecting turf and dealing with the egos of the
participants in the partnering process is necessary if successful solutions are
to develop. One must remember that the partners are human, not just a public
agency, a private entity or a citizen group. Mutual respect is mandatory.
6. Mutual Agreement. Develop the problem definition; alternatives and solutions together-diverse partners see problems from different perspectives.
This diversity of participation in problem definition, alternative solutions
and strategy development increases the success of the solution. The partners
“buy-in” to the final strategy, being resources and expertise and become part
of the solution.
7. Flexible Plans. Develop flexible plans that can tackle issues, reinforce accom-

plishments and have the ability to adjust to new issues that emerge during
implementation. The flexible plan should be based upon the previous ground
rules.
Historical Approach to Community-Driven Approach
Historically, there have been attempts to address poverty and blight in neighbourhoods worldwide by involving residents of these blighted communities in one
form or another. In the 1960s, particularly in the USA, there was limited involvement of residents in the redevelopment efforts and the provision of housing. The
standard approach was for governments, school districts, community agencies,
nonprofits, and service providers to alone with their respective expertise, trying
to tackle an isolated component of the greater problem. In addition, the private
sector corporations, lending institutions, developers, real estate brokers, health
care providers – appeared to be more concerned with immediate financial returns
on their investments rather than long-term markets and or other socio-economic
gains (Drnevich, 1995).
In his article entitled, “Financing Community Development in the US: A
Comparison of “War on Poverty” and 1990s-Era Policy Approaches,” Dymski
1990, noted that the Federal anti-poverty policies of the 1960s sometimes incorporated asset-building program elements. One example of this is the 1966 CAAP
(Community Action Against Poverty) Programme, which provided community
residents with the resources needed to organise for independent change and to
apply for local public-good assets such as Head Start Programmes and community
health centres. The CAAP also included elements of employment development and
training to address concerns associated with unemployment and low skill levels.
The US Government’s efforts toward a community-driven approach to address
low-income housing from the 1960s to the 1990s focused on housing rehabilitation and revitalisation to remove urban ‘blight.’ The resultant effect is the
phenomenon known as gentrification. Existing residents from these “blighted”
areas could not afford the rehabilitated housing units or the newly constructed
ones. The government made provisions for some housing units to be set aside or
constructed for these residents. However, these were often located in the least
desirable part of the city.
During the three decades of the “war on poverty,” there were also efforts to
encourage various forms of economic development by supporting the establishment of community-based financial and business enterprise development.
JOURNAL OF A RTS SCIENCE AND T ECHNOLOGY
48 Vol. 14, No. 1, March 2022
The most noteworthy initiative was the incentives given to banks and financial
institutions under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Under the CRA,
these financial institutions were incentivised to provide credit for asset building
in marginalised urban areas.
Dymski (1990) concluded that the war on poverty programme that spanned
three decades in the United States had minimal impact because the focus was
skewed to incentivising the financial institutions and large commercial real estate
projects. But did not consider initiatives at the community level involving the
integration of the residents in the process.
Across the Atlantic, in Germany, like other countries in Europe in the 1990s,
there were also attempts at a community-driven approach to housing provision. The German Government instituted the Social City programme, a targeted
approach for integrated neighbourhood planning, community building and
local activism. The government-owned Social Housing Company operates in
a decentralised manner by collaborating with the cities and regions to provide
low-income housing solutions. The state-run company took on a facilitator role
in ensuring important community development initiatives were completed. The
community-driven housing development in the City of Hannover is a successful
example of Germany’s initiative. This project demonstrated that the entire neighbourhood could be impacted through skilled collaborating and relentless efforts.
For example, the project saw the establishment of a working group comprising of
community residents to address spaces throughout the district that were seen as
dangerous, unfriendly or full of blight. The community group signed a contract
with a property owner for an empty piece of land that was not in use, allowing
residents to turn the space once filled with garbage into a community garden.
They also tackled the provision of public open space for the children of the community by cleaning and refurbishing the children’s playground and organised the
young people in the community to pick up the garbage and clean up the various
neighbourhoods in Hannover. Crites (2017) pointed out that the success of the
programme is a direct result of the integrated community-driven approach.
The Post-Apartheid government in South Africa, in the mid to late 1990s,
initiated various laws and policies that stressed the importance of community
participation in response to the housing shortage. Unfortunately, these policies
did not stem the burgeoning issues associated with the housing shortage in that
country. In 2004, the South African government policies shifted focus away from
mere delivery of vast numbers of houses towards creating sustainable human
settlements.
Community-Driven Approach and Housing Provision in Jamaica
Vol. 14, No. 1, March 2022 49
The government anticipated that such problems as peripheral residential development; poor quality of housing construction; lack of community participation;
corruption and maladministration; limited, or decreasing public sector participation; an increasing housing backlog; and the continued growth of informal
settlements would be addressed by this shift in policy focus.
Unfortunately, as asserted by Juta, Moeti and Matsiliza (2014), South Africa
inherited a monumental national housing crisis, which was fundamentally complicated by a longstanding culture of a lack of both popular and community
participation in matters of governance and service delivery (Juta & Matsiliza,
2014). While the theories of community-driven development were understood
and influenced the development of the various housing programmes. Zonke and
Matsilizae (2015) are of the opinion that the principle of community participation
as is espoused in the provision of low-income housing tends be associated with
vague utterances as ‘the will of the people’, ‘people’s democracy’, ‘the people
shall govern from below’ and ‘the common good’ – by both the government and
local community representatives. However, the implementation of these projects
demonstrated the ambiguity of ‘participation.’ These South African scholars
and I share that community participation in housing development is the direct
involvement of the average person in the affairs of governance and the overall
housing development programmes at the grass-roots level.
Based on their analysis of the 2007 community-driven housing initiative in
the Khayelitsha Township in Western Carpe, the researchers concluded that it
housing initiative was void of community engagement. The residents claimed
that, prior to the housing delivery, the government had not consulted them,
regarding housing design nor the quality standards required. When asked about
the quality of their RDP house, 88% of Khayelitsha respondents expressed deep
concern about how small it was.
As a result, the absence of their voices effectively destroyed any prospects of
the residents having a sense of community belonging, identity or pride in such
a project. In short, Khayelitsha residents expressed a feeling of isolation and
exclusion from the state in the provision of low-income housing units.
It is fair to say that the Jamaican experience the community-driven development and housing has yielded mixed results. PRIDE and the Inner-City Housing Programme implemented in the early 2000s are two examples that provide
mixed evidence to support the importance of community-driven development
in providing low-income housing units.
In 2004, then Prime Minister, PJ Patterson launched the NHT’s Inner-City
JOURNAL OF A RTS SCIENCE AND T ECHNOLOGY
50 Vol. 14, No. 1, March 2022
Housing Project (ICHP). It targeted communities characterised by high unemployment, low educational levels and residents living in substandard housing
conditions such as severe overcrowding, lack of regular piped water and poor
sanitation facilities. As of October 30, 2009, 1203 households had benefitted from
ICHP units located in Denham Town, Monaltrie and Trench Town and along
Spanish Town Road. These units were provided at the cost of $1. 724 billion
(Burke, 2010, p. 21).
While the government provided the much-needed housing units at a subsidised
rate, the creation or facilitation of community institutions to support empowerment, governance and other fundamental principles of community-driven
development was limited at best. In her analysis of the Inner City Housing Programme, Spence (2007) noted that the governance model applied in the ICHP
was a result of adjustments among the demands of the beneficiaries, the mandate
and ‘location’ of the NHT and the formal and informal political culture. While
there were changes in the attitudes of the residents, Spence conceded that some
changes were examples of a recent, slow and more general move away from the
traditional dependency model and its definition of ‘rights’ to a concept of governance in which the responsibilities and self-reliance of the citizen is emphasised.
Other changes took place because they did not threaten aspects of the status quo.
I note with interest that there was no reference to the development of community
institutions in facilitate the pre and post housing initiative. Perhaps the high rate
of non-compliance for payment for their housing units is evidence of this limited
consideration of the community-driven development approach associated with
the ICHP. The activities that would normally be facilitated by community residents were taken fully by the National Housing Trust – the housing provider. As
George (2007) admitted, the programme failed to mobilise a significant number
of participants to enroll in the various training programmes, including training
on enterprise economic development, notwithstanding paltry wages offered to
those who complete training.
Similar to the South African experience discussed above, residents express
dissatisfaction with the internal design and layout of the units. As George (2007)
noted, residential satisfaction levels were higher among owners of new units.
However, he acknowledged that current satisfaction levels with elements and
with the apartment as a whole are likely to fall over time as wear and tear removes
the ‘shine’ of newness.
It is interesting to note that none of the analyses of the ICHP in Jamaica
considered the role of community-driven development to enhance the success
Community-Driven Approach and Housing Provision in Jamaica
Vol. 14, No. 1, March 2022 51
of the programme. Wynter Burke, for example, in her assessment of the high
incidents of arrays, advised that Trust has tried getting the Members of Parliament – the political directorate to assist with arrears. However, the results have
been disappointing at best. The examples of the community financial institutions
established to assist this housing development in the US is one example, which
could be considered in the Jamaican context.
The Role of Community-Based Organisation in Community-Drive
Development
Community-based organisations (CBO) are often geographically defined and
comprised of groups of individuals with similar interests coming together to
further those to further those common interest. CBO’s often have informal origins – informal in the sense that a group of persons with common interests join
together without being formally constituted, unlike service clubs such as Rotary
or Kiwanis. Membership in a CBO is voluntary and often broad-based. CBO’s
participation in the community development process allows its members and
the wider community to actively respond to poverty alleviation initiatives by
informing the initiatives.
There is a preponderance of evidence to suggest that CBO’s playing an integral
role in the community development process for poverty alleviation improves
efficiency and effectiveness. In a study done by Sara and Katz (1997) of community
development in six countries, they concluded that the sustainable initiatives that
were sustainable were those in which the communities “controlled key investment decisions and part of the investment cost” (p. 32). Similarly, in a study of
CBO’s involvement in the development process in South Africa, Adatos et al.
(1999) pointed out that CBO’s involvement in all aspects of project development
(design, management & monitoring) helped to reduce cost per beneficiary by
approximately 50% (Dongier et al., 2004, p. 7).
Social Capital and the Community-Driven Development Process
The community-driven development process is an important vehicle that allows
communities to build social capital. Broadly defined, social capital refers to social
organisations, networks and interaction that are created in a community. These
networks and interactions are made possible when there is a sense of trust and
civic-mindedness among members of the community (Putnam, 1993). Ellie Carroll
JOURNAL OF A RTS SCIENCE AND T ECHNOLOGY
52 Vol. 14, No. 1, March 2022
(2010) qualified Putnam earlier assertion by noting, “Social capital consists of
reciprocity and trust, which may be channelled to facilitate cooperation in order
to achieve a mutual benefit among participants” (Caroll, 2010, p.135). Reciprocity
and trust are cultivated through daily personal connections, allowing a community to become something other than “just people living near each other.” Civic
engagement, which compels those living in the society to cooperate, cultivates
trust and demands more on behalf of the community as a whole, rather than
each individual demanding more for himself.
Putnam’s research on communities throughout Italy showed that those communities with norms and networks of civic engagement directly correlated with
the effectiveness of representative government. In essence, the social networks and
interaction at the community level brings about civic engagement and allow the
government to be more responsive. This interaction, according to Putnam, does
not require the involvement of “key” stakeholders. It does, however, require the
geographic space and social institutions to foster this kind of social interaction
(Archer, 2005).
Verba and Nie (1972), the earlier proponents of this debate, argued that social
capital is necessary for political participation. They believed that community-based organisations, civic associations, and non-governmental associations
are important in cultivating strong civic-mindedness among their members
and linking community leaders and residents to elected officials. According to
Verba and Nie, not only will participation provide political linkages, but it will
also provide members with exposure to political discourse. Exposure to this
discourse will allow citizens to feel and think that they can play a role in governance. Furthermore, the more people are exposed to the discourse, the more
they will request the government to be responsive to their needs. By extension,
the government will become more responsive to the needs of individuals because
they are in constant communication with the people.
From Putnam’s definition, it can be argued that many communities in Jamaica
have the pre-requisite social capital. This, according to Putnam, is a pre-condition
for socio-economic modernisation. However, in the context of Jamaica, there
is no clear indication that the existence of social capital is linked to poverty
alleviation. Grootaert’s (1999) research on poverty alleviation in Africa and Asia
directly linked social capital formation on those continents with the reduction in
poverty, particularly in urban areas. Grootaert concluded that the extent of social
capital formation in these countries “helped to reduce the household exposure
to their risk of falling below the poverty threshold” (p. 25). He also argued that,

“poor individuals and households manage risk in many ways, including offering
reciprocal self-help, participating in local organisations and building linkages.
This was most evident in using the social links to access funds through rotating
savings and credit associations (Dongier et al., 2004, p. 8).
Measuring the Impact of Community-Driven Development
Since the 1970s, researchers have attempted to measure the impact of community
development initiatives. These analyses have focused primarily on community
development initiatives in developed countries, particularly the United States.
Most noted among the researchers are Rossi (1999), Taub (1990) and Weiss (1972,
1998). According to Galster et al. (2004), there are varying challenges to measuring
the impacts of community development initiatives. These challenges vary for the
following reasons:
• The intervention may not be discrete and/or may occur in multiple phases.
This makes it difficult to ascertain precisely pre and post-intervention periods.
• The effects are not evident until after a prolonged period.
• The effect may be difficult to measure, especially if they involve changes in
residents’ perceptions, beliefs and attitudes.
• The indicators being measured might vary between communities, or they
might not be evident.
• The effect may be produced by synergistic relationships, making it difficult
to attribute the cause and effects with certainty.
• The effects of the initiative might spread across several community boundaries, thus clouding the level of impact.
• There is an inherent difficulty in identifying those residents who benefited
as they might relocate; thus, the full impact of the initiative might not be
captured fully.
• There is an inherent bias in the communities selected for any development
initiatives. The initiative might have targeted the communities, likely to yield
positive outcomes.
As a result of the existing limitations noted above, Galster et al. (2004) adopted
a new approach to measuring the impact of community-driven development
initiatives. The researchers used the “Adjusted Interrupted Time-series (AITS)
approach. This method compares pre and post-intervention trends in a targeted

neighbourhood after taking into account factors that affect the measured outcome in poor inner-city communities (Galster et al., 2004, p. 503). Based on
their analysis, the researcher argued that in the three case studies of large scale,
community development initiatives, there was an increase in single-family home
prices – one of the outcome indicators. In essence, with respect to housing prices,
there was a positive correlation between community development initiatives
(housing renovation, job creation & housing prices).
In the case of Jamaica, further analysis is needed to effectively measure the
impact of community-driven development initiatives. Particularly, in light of
the 10th year anniversary of the establishment of the Jamaica Social Investment
Fund supported by the World Bank, the adjusted interrupted time-series method
is one method, which can be employed to determine the impact of community
development initiatives in Jamaica.
Effectiveness of Community-Driven Development
In lauding the community-driven development in the provision of low-income
housing, a researcher from South Africa noted that this approach provides the
following:
• Increase the efficiency and minimise the costs of managing housing projects.
• Improve the effectiveness, and achieve policy objectives aimed at providing
human settlements for the poor.
• Empower communities to participate in decisions affecting them and strive
to improve their living conditions.
Most importantly, community participation can ameliorate many of the intervening and immediate problems being experienced by the community, and it can
also be a means of addressing community problems in the long term.
Community-driven development can only be effective in poverty alleviation
and low-income housing development if the rules of engagement are clearly established, widely accepted and understood. The rules of engaging the individuals
and communities must allow for the creation of space, physical or other types,
for the people to debate issues and participate in the local and national priority
setting, budget formation and delivery of basic services (World Bank, 2002, p. vi).
Furthermore, for the community-driven development process to be effective,
the following must be adhered to:

1. Develop the capacity at the local and municipal level of government to support the development process. Currently, in the Jamaican context, there is a
lack of trust between the citizenry and the bureaucrats. The citizens are of
the view that the bureaucrats are not committed to the community-driven
development process.
2. Develop the capacity of the community-based organisations. CBOs now
have greater responsibility to facilitate their members’ access to information
and participation in the wider decision-making process. Without the proper
leadership, this cannot be achieved.
3. Establish a clear system of transparency and accountability for the partners
in the development process.
4. Develop clear existing strategies for the partners in the development process. Partners can overstay their involvement in the development process,
particularly private sector and donor agencies, thus creating the converse of
empowerment – dependency.
5. CBOs should be held to task to provide mandatory contributions (in cash or
kind). This, according to Dongier et al. (2004), has proven to be important
in building community ownership, helping to ensure willingness to pay
and maintain services. This contribution can be collected through upfront
financial contribution, set-up cost, revenues from increased property taxes,
or user fees.
Listed below are guiding principles of community-driven development. These
principles are widely accepted by the World Bank and other donor agencies.
• Establishing relevant institutional and policy reform ensures that the community development process is followed.
• Make investment responsive to informed demand. Informed by the partners
in the development process.
• Build a participatory mechanism for community control and stakeholder
involvement.
• Ensure involvement of all under-represented groups (particularly women
& children).
• Build the capacity of CBOs.
• Allow CBO greater access to information.
When all these principles are adhered to an environment should be created
that provide the opportunity for the poor to earn an income to provide for their
basic needs. It is on this basis that poverty will be alleviated.
